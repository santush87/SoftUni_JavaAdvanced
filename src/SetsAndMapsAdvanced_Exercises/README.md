<h2>Problem 2.	Sets of Elements</h2>
<p>On the first line, you are given the length of two sets N and M. On the next N + M lines there are N numbers, that are in the first set and M numbers that are in the second one. Find all non-repeating element that appears in both of them, and print them in the same order at the console:</p>
<p>Set with length N = 4: {1, 3, 5, 7}</p>
<p>Set with length M = 3: {3, 4, 5}</p>
<p>Set that contains all repeating elements -> {3, 5}</p>

<h2>Problem 5.	Phonebook</h2>
<p>Write a program that receives some info from the console about people and their phone numbers.</p>
<p>You are free to choose how the data is entered. Each entry should have just one name and one number (both of them strings). If you receive a name that already exists in the phonebook, simply update its number.</p>
<p>After filling this simple phonebook, upon receiving the command "search", your program should be able to perform a search of contact by name and print her details in the format "{name} -> {number}". In case the contact isn't found, print "Contact {name} does not exist.".</p>
