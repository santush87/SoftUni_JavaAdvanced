<h3>1.	Consumer Print</h3>
<p>Write a program that reads a collection of strings, separated by one or more whitespaces, from the console and then prints them onto the console. Each string should be printed on a new line. Use a Consumer<T>.</p>
<p>Examples</p>

<h3>2.	Knights of Honor</h3>
<p>Write a program that reads a collection of names as strings from the console and then appends "Sir" in front of every name and prints it back onto the console. Use a Consumer<T>.</p>
<p>Examples</p>

<h3>3.	Custom Min Function</h3>
<p>Write a simple program that reads a set of numbers from the console and finds the smallest of the numbers using a simple Function<Integer[], Integer>.</p>
<p>Examples</p>

<h3>4.	Applied Arithmetic</h3>
<p>On the first line, you are given a list of numbers. On the next lines you are passed different commands that you need to apply to all numbers in the list: "add" -> adds 1; "multiply" -> multiplies by 2; "subtract" -> subtracts 1; "print" -> prints all numbers on a new line. The input will end with an "end" command, after which the result must be printed.</p>
<p>Examples</p>

<h3>5.	Reverse and Exclude</h3>
<p>Write a program that reverses a collection and removes elements that are divisible by a given integer n. </p>
<p>Examples</p>

<h3>6.	Predicate for Names</h3>
<p>Write a predicate. Its goal is to check a name for its length and to return true if the length of the name is less or equal to the passed integer. You will be given an integer that represents the length you have to use. On the second line, you will be given a string array with some names. Print the names, passing the condition in the predicate. </p>
<p>Examples</p>

<h3>7.	Find the Smallest Element</h3>
<p>Write a program that is using a custom function (written by you) to find the smallest integer in a sequence of integers. The input could have more than one space. Your task is to collect the integers from the console, find the smallest one and print its index (if more than one such elements exist, print the index of the rightmost one).</p>
<p>Examples</p>

<h3>8.	Custom Comparator</h3>
<p>Write a custom comparator that sorts all even numbers before all odd ones in ascending order. Pass it to an Arrays.sort() function and print the result.</p>
<p>Examples</p>

<h3>9.	List of Predicates</h3>
<p>Find all numbers in the range 1..N that is divisible by the numbers of a given sequence. Use predicates.</p>
<p>Examples</p>

<h3>10.	Predicate Party!</h3>
<p>The Wire’s parents are on a vacation for the holidays and he is planning an epic party at home. Unfortunately, his organizational skills are next to non-existent so you are given the task to help him with the reservations.
On the first line, you get a list of all the people that are coming. On the next lines, until you get the "Party!" command, you may be asked to double or remove all the people that apply to the given criteria. There are three different options: </p>
<p>•	Everyone that has a name starts with a given string.</p>
<p>•	Everyone that has a name ending with a given string. </p>
<p>•	Everyone has a name with a given length.</p>
<p>When you print the guests that are coming to the party, you have to print them in ascending order. If nobody is going, print "Nobody is going to the party!". See the examples below:</p>
<p>Examples</p>
